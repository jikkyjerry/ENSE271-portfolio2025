Grocery Delivery App
This app allows both customers and Stores to create account, its is design in  a way that, we can can only deliver groceries purchased from registered stores for a more secure transaction.

Membership: 
This is to make the application more flexible for users.
the idea of monthly, yearly plans with a low cost.

Tracking:
 The idea of tracking is not just to make shipment, but also to generate tracking number, get driver information, navigate driver current location and also text or call the driver.
the idea of tracking is to help users have  more control on their deliveries. which allows them to talk to the driver and do more o n the application.

Address:
 the App allows you to save two addresses(home and office) so you don't have to be imputting your address everytime time you want to make shipment.
There is also an option to input a different address.

Additional card colours is the extra feature i tried.
